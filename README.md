## Overview  
The goal is to predict house prices using features like square footage, number of rooms, and other housing data. The project implements best practices for machine learning operations (MLOps), ensuring robust deployment and maintainability.  

### Key Objectives:  
- Automate model training, testing, and deployment with CI/CD pipelines.  
- Containerize the application for portability and scalability.  
- Implement API-based model serving.  
- Monitor the deployed system for performance and reliability.  

---

## Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and prepares data for modeling.  
- **Model Training**: Uses a Random Forest Regressor for predictions.  
- **API Serving**: FastAPI-based REST API for real-time predictions.  
- **Containerization**: Dockerized application for consistent deployment.  
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics integrated for performance monitoring.  

---

## Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python (3.9)  
- **Libraries**:  
  - pandas, scikit-learn, joblib (Model Training)  
  - FastAPI, uvicorn (API Development)  
  - prometheus-client (Monitoring)  
- **Tools**:  
  - Git, GitHub Actions (Version Control & CI/CD)  
  - Docker (Containerization)  
  - Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)  
  - Prometheus, Grafana (Monitoring)

## Setup  

### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.9+  
- Docker  
- Git  

### Installation  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-mlops.git  
   cd house-price-mlops  
   ```  

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. **Train the Model**  
   ```bash  
   python train_model.py  
   ```  

4. **Run the API**  
   ```bash  
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000  
   ```  

5. **Docker Setup**  
   - Build the image:  
     ```bash  
     docker build -t house-price-api .  
     ```  
   - Run the container:  
     ```bash  
     docker run -p 8000:8000 house-price-api  
     ```

## Usage  

### API Endpoints  
- **`POST /predict`**  
  Submit features as JSON to get a house price prediction.  
  ```json  
  {  
      "feature1": value1,  
      "feature2": value2,  
      "feature3": value3  
  }  
  ```  

- **`GET /metrics`**  
  Access Prometheus metrics for monitoring.  

---

## CI/CD Pipeline  
The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions.  
- **On Push to Main Branch**:  
  - Lint and test the code.  
  - Build Docker images.  

Refer to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for details.  

---

## Deployment  
The project can be deployed to a cloud platform like AWS using Terraform.  
1. Modify the `main.tf` file with your AWS credentials.  
2. Deploy resources:  
   ```bash  
   terraform init  
   terraform apply  
   ```  

---

## Monitoring  
- Access metrics via the `/metrics` endpoint.  
- Visualize metrics in Grafana by connecting to Prometheus.
